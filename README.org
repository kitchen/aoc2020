#+title: Advent of Code 2020

This is my repo for the Advent of Code 2020.

I am planning to do this whole event from my iPad using blink.sh to ssh to my raspberry pi. I also hope to do this all in rust as a way to help learn rust. My fallback language will probably be golang, but I'm really going to try to do it all in rust.

Enjoy!
