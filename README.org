#+title: Advent of Code 2020

This is my repo for the Advent of Code 2020.

I am planning to do this whole event from my iPad using blink.sh to ssh to my raspberry pi. I also hope to do this all in rust as a way to help learn rust. My fallback language will probably be golang, but I'm really going to try to do it all in rust.

Enjoy!

Per the LICENSE.txt file, this code is public domain. I don't think most of it would really be copyrightable anyways, but just in case, have fun, do with it what you please.
